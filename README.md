# python_Small_A.I_Project
In this we used some basic functions of python to make some kind of voice assistant.

(1). prerequitise: When you want to search anything from web then you must have to say 'wikipedia' at the end. for example 'who is prime minister of India wikipedia'
(2). right now this algorithm can able to open youtube or google from your pc but you can improve it by adding more apps opened by this algorithm
(3). it can also tell you the exact time in your area by saying it 'tell me correct time'.......

 Thanks..
